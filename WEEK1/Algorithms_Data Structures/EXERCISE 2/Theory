Exercise 2: E-commerce Search

Big O Notation:
    .Measures algorithm speed as data grows
    .O(1) = instant, O(n) = linear growth, O(log n) = fast even for large n

Search Types:
    .Linear search: Check each item (O(n))
    .Binary search: Split sorted data in half (O(log n))

Best For E-commerce:
    .Binary search better for large catalogs
    .Needs sorted data first
