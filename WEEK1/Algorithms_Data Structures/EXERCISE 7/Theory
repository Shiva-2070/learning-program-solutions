Exercise 7: Financial Forecast

Recursion:
    .Function calls itself
    .Needs base case to stop
    .Example: Compound interest

Optimization:
    .Memoization (store results)
    .Avoid duplicate calculations
    .Watch for stack overflow
    
Time Complexity:
    .O(n) for n periods
    .Can be optimized to O(1)
